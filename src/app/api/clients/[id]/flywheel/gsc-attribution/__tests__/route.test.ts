/**
 * Manual GSC attribution route — the user-visible half of Issue #859's
 * write-vs-reconciliation split.
 *
 * A post-write cleanup failure does not take the outcome rows back out of the
 * database, so this route must not answer "nothing landed" (502) for a run that
 * wrote three rows. But it must still fail loudly when the writes themselves
 * failed. `errors[]` holds both kinds, so `cleanup_errors` is what tells them
 * apart — these tests pin that distinction from the caller's side.
