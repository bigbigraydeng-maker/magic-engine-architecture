/**
 * Customer brief generation — turns a stored Messenger thread into the card a
 * client's salesperson reads (see brief-schema.ts).
 *
 * Trigger rules live here rather than in the cron route so they can be tested
 * without HTTP. A brief is (re)written only when ALL of these hold:
 *   1. the thread has at least one message
 *   2. nobody has spoken for QUIET_PERIOD_MS — summarise a finished exchange,
 *      not a half-typed one
 *   3. there is no brief yet, or the thread has grown since the last one
 *   4. the thread has not already been rewritten MAX_REGENS_PER_DAY times today
 *
 * Rule 4 is the one that matters commercially: without it a fast back-and-forth
 * re-summarises on every single message.
 *
 * 🔴 2026-09-13 事故：这个文件曾经把系统提示词写死成"你是 CTS Tours New Zealand"，
 *    且调用链没有传 clientId —— 结果每一个客户（不只 CTS）生成的摘要都在冒充 CTS 身份，
 *    还给物流客户 New Asian Logistics 编出"客户想了解中国旅游"这种不存在的需求。
 *    修复：generateBrief 现在强制要求 clientId，身份从 `clients.name` 动态读取
 *    （见 loadClientIdentity），trip（旅游行程专属字段）只对 `industry === 'travel'`
 *    的客户开放、其余客户在代码层强制清空，且明显是垃圾/钓鱼消息的对话直接短路成
 *    noiseBrief，不再进模型编需求。

LANGUAGE — this is the most common mistake, get it right:
- summary, customer_needs, objections, promises_made, next_action, risk_flags: write in SIMPLIFIED CHINESE. Staff read these in a Chinese interface.
- draft_reply: write in ENGLISH. It is sent to the customer.
- When quoting the customer inside a Chinese field, keep their original English in brackets.

ATTRIBUTION — the mistake that makes a card useless. Every field under "trip" and "contact" describes what the CUSTOMER told us. Anything the ${business} side said — a date we offered, a price we quoted, something we suggested — is OUR information, not theirs.
- If ${business} quoted a price and the customer said nothing about money, budget_signal is null. A quote is not a budget.
- If ${business} named a date and the customer never named one, travel_window is null. A date we offered is not their travel window.
- contact.phone / contact.email only from details the customer supplied (lead forms put them in the first message). Never ${business}'s own support number or email.

${tripInstructions(isTravel)}

GROUNDING — only use what is in the thread:
- Never invent names, prices, dates, or other specific details that are not in the thread or in CLIENT FACTS below.
- If the customer asked something the thread does not answer, say so in next_action and leave draft_reply asking rather than guessing.
- promises_made must capture EVERY commitment the ${business} side made ("we'll send you...", "a specialist will call you within 24 hours"). Staff cannot honour a promise they never saw. An offer the customer has not accepted ("would you like more details?") is NOT a promise.
- If the thread is spam, an unrelated promotional broadcast, or otherwise has nothing to do with ${business}'s actual business: customer_needs MUST be an empty array and risk_flags must say so ("疑似垃圾/推广消息，非真实客户咨询"). Never invent a plausible-sounding need to fill the field.
${clientFactsBlock(facts)}
next_action must be a concrete thing a salesperson does today, in the imperative — "打电话给 Kam，确认出行月份". Never "等待客户回复": if the customer has gone quiet, chasing them IS the action, and the elapsed time below tells you how overdue it is.

draft_reply rules (it goes to a real customer as ${business}):
- Warm, plain English. Two or three sentences. No hype words.
- If the thread is about refunds, cancellations, changes, payment, insurance, medical or accessibility needs, or a complaint: do not attempt to resolve it. Draft a short reply saying a ${business} specialist will come back to them.`
