/**
 * Actions no evaluator can attribute — Issue #859, Codex P1 on PR #862.
 *
 * An action whose `expected_metric` is owned by an evaluator that cannot load
 * its flywheel will never produce an outcome: the owner never sees it, and the
 * `flywheel_outcomes_evaluator_owns_metric` CHECK forbids anyone else writing
 * it. Attribution detects this every run, but a count in a cron summary is not
 * a report — CLAUDE.md §3 is explicit that a finding which cannot be fixed
 * automatically has to reach a human through the same pipeline as everything
 * else, with what / how / href.
 *
 * This audit is the detection half. It reads the same routing rule the writers
 * use, so it cannot disagree with them about which actions are stranded.

 * metric family, the rows it already wrote become unmaintainable. Pass 1 will
 * not touch them — they are not its evaluator's — and the owning evaluator
 * cannot load the action, so it never sees them either. They are frozen at
 * whatever they last said, while still being read as evidence.
 *
 * DELETING THEM IS NOT AN OPTION. A writer removing rows it does not own is the
 * exact defect this Work Package removed (main's `DELETE WHERE action_id = ?`),
 * and re-adding it under a narrower condition would just make the same mistake
 * harder to see. So this is detection: it goes to a human through the same
 * pipeline as everything else, and a human decides.
 *
 * Throws on a query failure — "no orphans" and "we could not check" must not
 * look the same. (Codex P2, round 19 on PR #862.)
