/**
 * flywheel_outcomes identity — Issue #859 (Attribution Correctness)
 *
 * One business outcome = "what did action A do to metric M over a W-day window".
 * That triple is the natural key; it is enforced by the
 * `flywheel_outcomes_natural_key` UNIQUE constraint (migration
 * 20260808000001_flywheel_outcomes_identity_expand.sql).
 *
 * `evaluator_key` is deliberately *not* part of the key. Two evaluators that
 * answer the same (action, metric, window) question are producing competing
 * answers to one fact, not two facts.
 *
 * That decision only holds up if a natural key can never be produced by two
 * evaluators, because otherwise "which answer is true" degrades into "which
 * writer ran last" — and a stable row id whose verdict flips with the cron
 * schedule is worse than an unstable one, since downstream memory would read
 * scheduling noise as a business reversal.
 *
 * So ownership is assigned per metric family, below: exactly one evaluator is
 * authoritative for any given metric_key, and a non-owner declines to write
 * rather than competing. Execution order cannot decide truth because only one
 * writer ever produces the row. The same rule is enforced in the database by
 * `flywheel_outcomes_evaluator_owns_metric`.
