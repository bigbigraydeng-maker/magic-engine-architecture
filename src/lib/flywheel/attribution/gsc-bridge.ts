/**
 * Bring one action's pre-#859 rows into line with what this deployment stands
 * behind. Two steps, in this order, both scoped to this action and this
 * evaluator's own metric vocabulary.
 *
 * WHY ANY OF THIS EXISTS. The expand migration backfills `evaluator_key` once,
 * at apply time, and the rollout then deliberately keeps the OLD code running
 * against the expanded table until #862 deploys. The old manual endpoint takes
 * any window from 1 to 90, so a 7-day run inside that gap writes a row the
 * finished backfill will never revisit — and nothing afterwards lands on that
 * natural key again, because the gate refuses custom windows and each writer
 * only recomputes its own cadence.
 *
 * [1] CLAIM — sign our own unsigned rows. Safe because the metric namespace
 *     decides ownership: `seo.gsc.*` has only ever been written by this
 *     evaluator, the same rule the backfill and the
 *     `flywheel_outcomes_evaluator_owns_metric` CHECK encode. Never overwrites
 *     an existing signature. Without it the contract migration's
 *     `NULL count = 0` precondition is permanently unsatisfiable.
 *
 * [2] RETIRE NON-AUTHORITATIVE WINDOWS — but only while dual-window is OFF.
 *     Signing a gap row is not enough on its own: it leaves the action holding
 *     BOTH a 7-day and a 28-day answer, and the memory consumers still count
 *     outcome ROWS, so that action's evidence is doubled — the exact harm
 *     `ATTRIBUTION_DUAL_WINDOW_ENABLED` exists to prevent. On main this could
 *     not happen, because every writer DELETEd by action before inserting, so
 *     an action never held more than one window. Removing that delete is right
 *     — it is what stopped the two writers destroying each other's rows — but
 *     it means "one window per action" has to be restored deliberately for as
 *     long as the gate is off. With the gate ON these rows are legitimate and
 *     nothing is retired. (Codex P1, round 16 on PR #862.)
 *
 * Order matters: the retire filters on our own `evaluator_key`, so it cannot
 * see a row that is still NULL. Claim first, then retire.
 *
 * Returns every error rather than the first: these are independent statements,
 * and reporting one while silently skipping the other is how a half-done
 * reconciliation reads as a clean run.
 */
/**
 * WHY THIS EVALUATOR DOES NOT CLAIM UNSIGNED ROWS.
 *
 * It used to (round 15): sign any `seo.gsc.*` row for an action that the expand
 * migration's backfill had left with a NULL `evaluator_key`, so the contract
 * migration's `evaluator_key IS NULL = 0` gate could be satisfied. That rested
 * on "the namespace proves the writer", and two rounds of review took the
 * proof apart:
 *
 *   · round 17 — old pass 1 had no ownership routing and attributed straight
 *     from `flywheel_metrics`, which already carries the three GSC keys. So an
 *     action whose `expected_metric` was a GSC key produced a
 *     flywheel_metrics-derived row AT that key. Narrowed: exclude the action's
 *     own expected_metric.
 *   · round 24 — that exclusion reads the CURRENT expected_metric, but the
 *     ambiguity was created by whatever it was AT THE TIME. Once the
 *     `action_unattributable` todo has a human correct A → B, the A row becomes
 *     claimable again and gets signed as ours.
 *
 * There is no third narrowing, because the missing fact is history: nothing in
 * the row says which metric the action promised when it was written, and no
 * query can recover it. Signing anyway would make the rollout gate pass while
 * the answer is wrong — downstream would read a flywheel_metrics-derived number
 * as an authoritative GSC measurement — and the claim runs before the maturity
 * check, so a client without snapshots would never have it recomputed and
 * corrected.
 *
 * So this evaluator signs only what it writes. An unsigned `seo.gsc.*` row is
 * left exactly as it is — not claimed, not retired (the retire filters on our
 * own evaluator_key, so it cannot see a NULL one) — and surfaces at rollout
 * step [2], where the expand migration's header carries the diagnostic query
 * and the two acceptable resolutions. A blocked gate a human can explain beats
 * an unblocked one built on a guess.
 *
 * Pass 1's claim is NOT symmetric with this and stays: it claims by excluding
 * every foreign namespace, and this evaluator has never written outside
 * `seo.gsc.*`, so a non-GSC unsigned row can only be pass 1's own. That one is
 * provable; this one is not.
 */

/**
 * Drop this evaluator's rows at any window other than the authoritative one —
 * only AFTER the authoritative window has actually been written.
 *
 * The ordering is the point. When I moved reconciliation ahead of the maturity
 * check in round 16, this delete came along with it, and that turned a
 * safeguard into data loss: with the gate off, an action holding only a 7-day
 * row from the deploy gap and not yet carrying a mature 28-day snapshot had its
 * one piece of evidence deleted, and then the recompute declined to run. The
 * action went from "some evidence" to none. (Codex P1, round 22 on PR #862.)
 *
 * Write-before-retire is the rule this whole Work Package established for the
 * upsert path; the window retire has to obey it too. Never delete the answer to
 * a question you still promise to answer until the replacement has landed.
 *
 * The cost is that an immature action can transiently hold two windows while
 * the gate is off — the harm the gate exists to prevent. That is the right
 * trade: a duplicate is recoverable and self-clears on the pass that finally
 * writes the authoritative window, whereas the deleted row is not recoverable
 * at all, because the very reason it was deleted is that we cannot recompute it.
