/**
 * Offerings fact layer loader (Issue #1577).
 *
 * `config/clients/<configSlug>/offerings.yaml` is the PM/FDE-maintained, hand-edited
 * source of truth for what a client is actually selling right now. This loader is
 * the ONLY supported way to read it: parse YAML, validate with Zod, cache in memory
 * for 5 minutes so the reply agent and the Verifier don't re-hit the filesystem on
 * every message.
 *
 * Why this exists: the incident that started the CTS Governed Reply project was
 * Meta's official AI reading a still-live website page and telling a customer a
 * retired tour was bookable. This file is the governance layer's only source of
 * "is this tour actually for sale" — the Agent reasoning layer (Issue F) and the
 * Verifier policy (Issue D) both read through here instead of trusting the website
 * or the model's own training knowledge.
 *
 * Platform note: this loader is client-agnostic AND client-identity-agnostic —
 * it takes a `configSlug` (the literal `config/clients/<slug>` directory name)
 * and knows nothing about DB `client_id` UUIDs. Codex review (PR #1626,
 * 2nd pass) correctly flagged an earlier version that hardcoded a single
 * CTS UUID → slug mapping table *inside this shared loader*: that put one
 * client's identity in `src/lib` and would have required editing shared
 * runtime code for every future client (me-platform-tier-gate 红线 2). That
 * mapping now belongs to whoever calls this loader for a specific client
 * (for CTS today, a one-line constant in the CTS-specific caller/policy file
 * — not here). `configSlug` has no default: this is a shared, multi-client
 * entry point, so a caller that omits it must fail loudly instead of silently
 * reading another client's facts.
