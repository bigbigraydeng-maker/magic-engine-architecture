# Merge authorization gate

The workflow in `pr-merge-authorization.yml` turns merge authorization into a
required, exact-revision check instead of relying on an agent remembering a
chat phrase.

One-time repository setup after the workflow reaches `main`:

1. Create the GitHub Environment `merge-authorization`.
2. Add Ray as its sole required reviewer and prevent administrator bypass.
3. In the `main` ruleset, require the status check `Merge authorization (Ray)`.
4. Do not grant automation tokens permission to approve protected environments.

Operating rule:

- Draft PRs need no approval and cannot be merged.
- When a PR becomes ready, its current head waits for environment approval.
- Every new commit cancels the prior run and creates a new approval request, so
  an approval cannot silently carry over to changed code.
- `GO MERGE #<number>` remains the human instruction in Build Control. The
  controller may open the matching environment approval for Ray, but it must
  never infer authorization from “continue”, “candidate”, or “visual pass”.

This gate never merges, deploys, publishes, or contacts a paid provider.
