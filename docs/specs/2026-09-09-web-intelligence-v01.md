Contract: [#1497](https://github.com/bigbigraydeng-maker/magic-engine/issues/1497), PM GO BUILD comment 5587778033. Risk A. This document supersedes the pre-build audit. Status: PR #1500 merged; production migration and CTS-only pilot explicitly approved and enabled on 2026-09-09 NZ time. Compatibility fixes #1506/#1507 merged and live (bb19965f1a7ad5f132478d5c2080e13a08589d51).

## Scope and reuse

Existing competitor resolver + `clients.competitor_domains` + the client's Industry Baseline cohort remain the identity sources. `competitor_monitoring_metadata` only annotates existing identities; it cannot create a second competitor list. Legacy resolver callers keep their behavior; this flow opts into fail-closed reads. Tiers core/secondary/benchmark/watch combine with active/emerging/archive status and additive source history/tags.

Shared runtime: Apify website adapter, snapshots/evidence/signals, bounded interpretation, client-scoped budget ledger and Inngest workflows. Existing Industry Baselines gets a Web intelligence tab. Industry meaning comes from the existing baseline cohort and configured context; client IDs, URLs, entitlement, FX and schedules are configuration. No CTS name, ID, private facts or travel rules enter shared runtime. Reuses existing Apify, Anthropic, paid-client/admin authorization and Inngest infrastructure. No alternate provider, custom worker or action execution is added.

Website pipeline: reserve → durably claim paid capture → Apify run receipt → validate dataset → immutable snapshot/full evidence → content diff → bounded LLM interpretation with owned evidence citations → threat/opportunity/ignore + recommended action → actual cost settlement. First snapshot is baseline; unchanged snapshots skip LLM. Outputs are recommendations only. Six service-only tables and five restricted RPCs are additive; the migration contains no client/baseline seeds; authorized activation writes are recorded below.

## Controls and limitations

All clients are disabled by default. Environment allowlist, enabled flag and entitlement must all pass. $499/month is a reserved entitlement field, not Stripe billing; billing currency is explicitly selected. Target NZ$30/month pauses non-core work; NZ$50/month rejects new reservations under a per-client database lock. Auckland month boundaries, fresh explicit USD/NZD rate, unknown costs and prior-month unsettled work are checked. Unknown paid requests retain their reservation and block further spending; paid calls are not retried blindly. Actual overages are recorded without truncation and block subsequent runs. Provider budget caps plus worst-case LLM reservation bound dispatched work; this cannot retroactively undo an upstream provider billing anomaly.

Apify version is pinned by configuration. One approved same-domain HTTPS URL per run, one dataset item, bounded content/page/time/charge. Removed/archived competitors cannot run. Evidence text is untrusted data; model has no tools and strict classification/citation schema. A completed paid claim with missing receipt needs operator reconciliation, not replay. If infrastructure retries are exhausted before a status receipt can be persisted, Inngest failure history plus the held run must be inspected; no automatic refund/restart is provided in v0.1.

## Validation evidence

- 247 related Vitest tests across 16 files passed (runtime, adapter, routes, UI and existing integration boundaries).
- 18 isolated real PostgreSQL 17 checks passed using `scripts/test-web-intelligence-db.mjs`: additive migration, separate-connection concurrency, budget stop, replay, unknown-cost and cross-month holds, revocation, snapshot transitions, evidence integrity, non-finite money, cross-client FKs and RLS/RPC denial. Local test DB only.
- Four targeted mutants were killed: rollout allowlist, citation ownership, paid-call claim and SQL hard stop. Source restored after each mutant.
- Focused lint and production build passed. Build used dummy database settings, not production access.
- Full typecheck reports seven errors also reproduced on pristine exact main: four messenger send test `usedAiDraft` omissions and three ops-review test environment typing errors. No new type errors.
- Two independent implementation reviews and an additional security review completed; blocking findings resolved, focused regression tests passed.
- Desktop/mobile UI was rendered from the actual component with explicitly synthetic data; no mobile horizontal overflow or browser errors. These images are not CTS acceptance.

## CTS evidence and remaining gate

CTS uses its existing competitor identities plus its Industry Baseline cohort; no duplicate identity list was seeded. After the PM explicitly approved production database updates and pilot activation, `web_intelligence_v01` was applied. All six tables have RLS enabled and RPC permissions remain restricted. The production allowlist contains CTS only. Existing provider/model/Inngest configuration is reused without exporting credentials. Inngest synchronization returned Successfully registered.

CTS settings: enabled/entitled; reserved membership 499 NZD/month (no billing subscription created), target NZ$30/hard stop NZ$50, USD/NZD 1.706 dated 2026-09-08, collector build 0.3.97, capture cap US$0.10 and NZ$0.02 overhead/run. Only existing `wendywutours.co.nz` is configured for collection: core/active/manual, cts-pilot tag, homepage, 24h interval. Daily due-work evaluation runs at 06:00 Pacific/Auckland. Other clients remain excluded by the production allowlist.

Production baseline requested through Industry Baselines → Web Intelligence:
- request `e7b5e805-e56f-45b5-9814-7ca9708f1f00`, Apify `X60junDpOkJqCAOig`, provider SUCCEEDED and ledger complete.
- snapshot `efb3fd1d-5cab-4b01-9acd-fcdec05ef3f6`, captured 2026-09-08T17:20:00.217352Z, 19,393 characters, SHA256 `66fadcf98e7fbd949dfa822bbfc00a42b8d95d924c2d9e91061e02f7170bc872`.
- provider US$0.0009246625809520484, model US$0, accounted NZ$0.0215774743631041945704 including overhead. Initial baseline correctly skips interpretation.

Two activation-only compatibility fixes were needed: client GUID validation (#1506), and enabling the official Actor's required proxy (#1507). The latter input was validated against official build 0.3.97 (old input HTTP400, corrected input HTTP200). Rejected attempt `9bb6f20f-5992-4c4b-a04f-839cf2bb93a1` created no provider run (verified Actor run listing), so it was marked failed and settled at US$0 provider/model plus NZ$0.02 overhead. No unknown charge was blindly retried.

Second capture `828b0c7a-6f08-42c7-9f30-90c6ab0800ee` / Apify `3TbpMV1i1xp7qa630` also succeeded and produced a real content-change signal. Its model result failed validation/persistence, with the old generic error code; raw response was not retained, so the precise cause is not known. Provider US$0.0060086445602112355 plus model US$0.01974 settled at NZ$0.06392718761972037. A free count of the exact prompt returned 4,660 input tokens; this is inconsistent with a 1,000-output-token truncation given the recorded charge. A valid real LLM classification/recommendation receipt is still required. Never fabricate a change for that claim. The PM accepted three P2s for this pilot: stale settings drafts after UI refresh, missing claim-time reconciliation recheck for a previously reserved different URL, and normalized-content-limit failures not settling automatically. Keep this pilot single-URL and serial; inspect unresolved runs before adding targets. Disable the client setting to stop new paid work; reconcile already claimed work before releasing held costs.

## Planning estimate (not measured CTS costs)

Illustrative 579 single-page captures/month, 10–50% changed, 2,500 input + 500 output tokens per changed page, USD/NZD 1.70 as an assumption. Published browser crawler estimate US$0.50–5 / 1,000 pages implies US$0.29–2.90 capture usage; Sonnet US$3/15 per million input/output tokens implies US$0.87–4.35 interpretation; configured overhead NZ$0.02/capture adds NZ$11.58. Combined illustrative NZ$13.55–23.91/month. Separate-run overhead, account plans, polling/dataset requests, storage and actual token volume can raise this; real CTS receipts must calibrate the NZ$30 target. Current default reservation at this illustrative FX is NZ$0.615/run, released only against known actual costs.

## Next extensions

Hiring: job opening/closing and role mix. People: published leadership changes. Partnership/CSR: official announcements with named parties/date. Reviews: platform IDs, score/count and new-review evidence. Technology: observed stack or tracking changes. Each extends signal kind/extraction over the same snapshots, evidence, budget and recommendation boundary; evaluate Apify first and introduce another provider only with a documented capability gap. None is implemented in v0.1.
