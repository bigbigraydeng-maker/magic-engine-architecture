/**
 * The C-level sampling lane.

 * The property that matters is not "roughly 20%" — it is that the answer for a
 * given commit cannot change. A workflow re-run, a duplicate event delivery, or
 * an author who dislikes being sampled must all get the same result, otherwise
 * the marker ledger records a PR that changed its mind and a second
 * `@codex review` restarts the loop.
