/**
 * Deterministic blast-radius guard for the Codex-to-Claude auto-fix lane.
 *
 * 🔴 **Why this exists, and why prompt text is not enough.**
 *
 * The auto-fix leg feeds an untrusted review body into a Claude run that
 * commits and pushes. PR #941 first tried to contain that with prompt
 * engineering — an XML fence around the untrusted text plus "treat this as
 * data" wording. Codex's review of that attempt made the decisive point:
 *
 *   > XML 围栏只改变文本位置，无法区分正常的修复指令和被 PR 内容诱导出来的
 *   > 恶意修复指令 … 现有测试只验证字符串位于围栏内，并未验证模型不会服从它。
 *
 * That is correct. A fence relocates text; it cannot make a model refuse.
 * The prompt hardening stays (defence in depth, and it makes the honest cases
 * cleaner), but it is **not** the security boundary.
 *
 * This module is the boundary: it looks at the *result* — the files the PR
 * actually changed — and refuses to let the lane touch anything that could
 * widen its own permissions, alter production infrastructure, or change the
 * control plane that decides its own fate. It does not care what the prompt
 * said, whether the model complied, or how persuasive a finding was.
 *
 * Deliberate design choices:
 *
 * - **Whole-PR scope, not per-commit attribution.** Git author/committer
 *   fields are self-asserted; "only check commits by the bot" would be a
 *   guard an attacker can step around by setting an email. So on a lane where
 *   the bot can push, every changed file is checked. Humans working in this
 *   lane who genuinely need to touch a protected path do it on a branch
 *   outside the lane — which is a reviewable, visible act.
 * - **Fail closed.** Unknown branch, empty file list, malformed input → treat
 *   as a violation rather than a pass, because "no files" and "we failed to
 *   read the files" look identical otherwise.

/**
 * Head-branch prefixes the auto-fix leg is allowed to push to. Kept in sync
 * with the `if:` guard in ops-codex-to-claude-fix.yml by a test.
 *
 * Was `['claude/me2-']` — a narrow pilot lane, kept separate from the
 * review-request leg's `claude/*` scope specifically to avoid an unattended
 * push landing on a branch a live window was holding (CLAUDE.md §6, one
 * window per branch). Validated end-to-end on that lane (PR #1174:
 * Codex flagged a seeded bug P2, the dispatch fired, Claude pushed a correct
 * fix) before widening. The collision risk this used to sidestep by scope
 * alone is now handled by the staleness check in handle-review.mjs — see the
 * comment on `isStale` there.
