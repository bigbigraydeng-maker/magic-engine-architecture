/**
 * Workflow B (ops-codex-to-claude-fix.yml), step 3 — runs only when
 * handle-review.mjs decided 'dispatch-fix', after the Claude Action step has
 * finished (success or not).
 *
 * Codex finding (PR #906, P2): the previous design wrote the fix-dispatched
 * marker from inside handle-review.mjs, before the Claude Action step even
 * started. A timeout, auth failure, or failed push then still counted as a
 * used round, and decideStage's dedup check (hasMarkerForSha) would skip that
 * same sha forever after — not even a manual re-run of the failed job could
 * recover it, since re-running replays the same event and the marker was
 * already posted.
 *
 * Fix: post the marker ONLY on success. On failure, post a visible warning
 * instead and post no marker — so the next event for the same head sha (a
 * fresh Codex review, or a manual re-run of this same job replaying the
 * original event) sees no fix-dispatched marker yet and retries the same
 * round number rather than either silently stalling or skipping ahead.

// exited `success` having pushed nothing, and each announced "pushed the
// change" anyway. Every commit on that branch turned out to be hand-pushed.
// The usual cause is that the findings sit in files the dispatch prompt
// forbids Claude from editing (`.github/workflows/**`, `tools/ai-orchestrator/**`).
//
// A step's exit code is not evidence that a commit exists. Those three rounds
// also consumed the entire 3-round budget, so the loop then declared NEEDS
// HUMAN REVIEW ("3 rounds without a clean review") about work it had never
// actually attempted.
//
// Codex finding (PR #943, P2) — the first version of this fix compared against
// the sha in the review event, which is a stale baseline. Anything pushed
// between the review landing and this step (a human, another automation, a
// second window on the branch) would have been credited to Claude and charged
// against the budget. That is the same error as trusting the exit code,
// pointing the other way: neither says WHO moved the head.
//
// `HEAD_BEFORE` is read one step before claude-code-action runs (read-head.mjs),
// so this comparison brackets exactly this round. If it is missing — the step
// was skipped, or a future edit dropped it — fall back to reporting no push
// rather than guessing: over-reporting is the failure this file exists to stop.
