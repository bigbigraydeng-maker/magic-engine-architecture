/**
 * Workflow B entrypoint (ops-codex-to-claude-fix.yml). Runs when Codex
 * submits a review on a qualifying PR. Decides one of:
 *
 *   dispatch-fix  -> the workflow invokes claude-code-action directly with
 *                    the aggregated findings as its prompt, then a separate
 *                    step (mark-fix-outcome.mjs) records success/failure
 *   needs-human   -> post "NEEDS HUMAN REVIEW" and stop (round budget used up)
 *   ready         -> no actionable findings, CI green: evaluate delivery
 *                    quality (quality.mjs) and post READY FOR PRODUCT OWNER
 *                    or BLOCKED — see the `case 'ready'` handler below
 *   wait-ci       -> no actionable findings, and required CI still hasn't
 *                    gone green after polling within this run
 *   skip          -> this head sha already has a marker for the stage we'd write
 *
 * It never merges, deploys, applies a migration, or resolves a review thread.
 * `plan.mjs` holds the dispatch/round-cap decision logic and is unit-tested
 * in isolation; this file is the I/O glue around it.
 *
 * Round budget (ME2-OPS03 PR2): replaces the flat `MAX_ROUNDS = 3` with
 * `maxRoundsForRisk(risk)` (A=2, B=1, C=1), where `risk` is read off the
 * current trusted `me-dev-gate` marker — the same one `request-review.mjs`
 * posts on every push. No current trusted marker for this exact head (should
 * not happen in normal operation, since rating runs on every push before a
 * review can land, but a marker can be missing, stale, or untrusted) means
 * `risk` is `undefined`, and `maxRoundsForRisk` gives that the smallest
 * budget rather than the largest — fail closed, an unrated PR must not buy
 * more unattended pushes than a known-A one gets.
