/**
 * Workflow B entrypoint (ops-codex-to-claude-fix.yml). Runs when Codex
 * submits a review on a qualifying PR. Decides one of:
 *
 *   dispatch-fix  -> the workflow invokes claude-code-action directly with
 *                    the aggregated findings as its prompt, then a separate
 *                    step (mark-fix-outcome.mjs) records success/failure
 *   needs-human   -> post "NEEDS HUMAN REVIEW" and stop (3 rounds already used)
 *   ready         -> post "READY FOR PRODUCT OWNER" (no actionable findings, CI green)
 *   wait-ci       -> no actionable findings, and required CI still hasn't
 *                    gone green after polling within this run
 *   skip          -> this head sha already has a marker for the stage we'd write
 *
 * It never merges, deploys, applies a migration, or resolves a review thread.
 * `plan.mjs` holds the actual decision logic and is unit-tested in isolation;
 * this file is the I/O glue around it.
