/**
 * Workflow C entrypoint (ops-dev-gate-recheck.yml). Runs whenever the
 * `ai-orchestrator CI` workflow or the `ops-fix-scope-guard` workflow
 * completes anywhere in the repository — see the two 🔴 notes below for why
 * both. Exists for exactly the gap `handle-review.mjs` (the review-triggered
 * leg) cannot
 * close: a C-level PR `sampling.mjs`'s stable 20% sample did NOT select for
 * Codex review. Nothing then ever fires `pull_request_review.submitted` for
 * it, so without this leg an otherwise-done unsampled C-level PR would sit
 * forever with no READY / BLOCKED verdict — the "skip Codex and nobody ever
 * re-evaluates it" outcome ME2-OPS03 PR2 forbids.
 *
 * 🔴 **Why `workflow_run`, not `check_run`.** GitHub does not deliver
 * `check_run` events for check suites GitHub Actions itself created — that
 * is a deliberate anti-recursion rule
 * (https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#check_run).
 * `ai-orchestrator-tests` is exactly such a check suite, so a `check_run`
 * trigger here would never fire in production: this whole recheck leg would
 * be dead on arrival while looking wired. `workflow_run` has no such
 * exclusion and carries the same facts this script needs — `head_sha`,
 * `pull_requests`, `status`/`conclusion` — off `event.workflow_run` instead
 * of `event.check_run`.
 *
 * 🔴 **Why this listens for TWO workflows, not just `ai-orchestrator CI`.**
 * Codex finding (PR #1211, P2): `buildVerdictComment` (via `verdict.mjs`)
 * scores `scope-guard-green` off `ops-fix-scope-guard.yml`'s own check run,
 * not just the required CI's. That workflow triggers on the same
 * `pull_request` event as `ai-orchestrator CI` and the two race — whichever
 * finishes first used to be treated as "CI is done, decide now", locking in
 * a verdict computed while the other was still `queued`/`in_progress`. A
 * missing `scope-guard-green` point can be the difference between C's 75
 * threshold and a permanent, wrongly-deduped BLOCKED. `evaluateOne` below
 * now waits for BOTH check runs to reach `completed` before it will write
 * anything, and this workflow listens for either workflow's completion so
 * whichever one finishes SECOND is guaranteed to trigger the run that
 * actually writes the verdict.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow, and the two legs never race each other:
 *
 *   - This script only acts when the completed workflow run matches the
 *     required-workflow name pattern (everything else is ignored immediately).
 *   - For each PR the workflow run belongs to, it only proceeds when the PR's
 *     current trusted risk rating is C AND the stable sample did not select
 *     it for Codex review (`shouldRequestCodexReview` returning false).
 *   - Every A/B PR, and every sampled C, is left entirely to the
 *     review-triggered leg — a Codex review is either owed (this script
 *     backs off) or not (the review-triggered leg never runs for this sha in
 *     the first place, since nothing ever submits a review for it).
 *
 * Idempotency does not use the `ops-codex-loop:stage=` marker family
 * `plan.mjs` owns (that dedup is specific to the dispatch/round-cap state
 * machine this leg never touches). Instead it checks whether the current
 * trusted `me-dev-gate` marker already carries a `decision` — the same fact
 * `handle-review.mjs`'s `ready` case produces. Since the two legs are
 * mutually exclusive by construction (above), this is enough on its own.
 *
 * Never merges, deploys, applies a migration, or touches production.
