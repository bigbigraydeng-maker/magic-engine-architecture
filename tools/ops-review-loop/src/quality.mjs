/**
 * Delivery quality score and the hard gates that outrank it.
 *
 * The risk level (see `risk.mjs`) decides *how much process* a PR goes through.
 * This module decides *whether the result is good enough to hand to the Product
 * Owner*. They are separate questions and are deliberately not blended: an
 * A-level change with excellent evidence still gets A's process, and a C-level
 * change with no evidence at all still fails.
 *
 * 🔴 **Why the score is a sum of named signals rather than a judgement.**
 *
 * A "score out of 100" produced by a model is a number with the shape of
 * evidence and none of the substance — and the model producing it is the same
 * one that wrote the code. So nothing here scores anything. `scoreDelivery`
 * accepts a list of *signal ids* that a caller has already observed
 * (a check run's conclusion, a section present in the PR body, a test file in
 * the diff), looks each one up in a fixed table, and adds up the points. A
 * signal that was not observed contributes 0; there is no partial credit and no
 * "looks about right" path. An id the table does not contain throws, rather
 * than being silently ignored — an invented signal must not be able to buy
 * points, and a renamed one must break loudly instead of quietly scoring zero.
 *
 * 🔴 **Why hard gates outrank the total.**
 *
 * Points are fungible; safety is not. A PR could reach 92 on documentation and
 * reuse while its required CI is red. `decideReadiness` therefore evaluates the
 * hard gates first and independently: red CI, an unresolved Codex P0/P1/P2 on
 * the current head, a rating bound to a stale sha, missing A-level evidence, or
 * *any* unreadable input blocks readiness at any score.
 *
 * 🔴 **What Codex does and does not contribute here.**
 *
 * The native Codex GitHub App posts prose ("### 💡 Codex Review", a
 * "**Reviewed commit:** `<sha>`" line, then findings) — verified against real
 * reviews on PR #1204 (2026-08-27, four reviews across four head shas). It does
 * not emit a machine-readable quality object, and this module does not pretend
 * otherwise: `CODEX_QUALITY_FIELDS` is exported as `unavailable` so a report can
 * say so out loud. Codex's contribution to this decision is exactly one fact —
 * how many P0/P1/P2 findings stand against the current head, via the existing
 * `severity.mjs` heuristic — and that fact is a hard gate, not a score.
 *
 * Pure module: no I/O, no clock. `tests/quality.test.ts` exercises it offline.

 * What "the corresponding specialised evidence" means, per risk category.
 *
 * 🔴 Codex finding on PR #1205 (P1): this used to be one fixed requirement —
 * every A-level PR had to show client-isolation evidence. But a migration, a
 * workflow edit, a payment route and a dependency bump are all A and none of
 * them produce isolation evidence. Under the old rule they could never be
 * Ready, or their authors would write isolation prose they had not actually
 * verified — which is worse than no gate, because it manufactures false
 * evidence. This very PR is an A-level control-plane change and was one of the
 * ones permanently blocked.
 *
 * The rule the spec actually states is "按命中风险运行" — evidence matching the
 * risks *hit*. So: `classifyRisk` reports the categories, this table says what
 * each one owes, and `evaluateSpecializedEvidence` compares required against
 * observed. A category with no entry here owes nothing; a category the table
 * does not recognise owes an explicit manual sign-off rather than nothing.

/**
 * Why an A-level PR's specialised-evidence evaluation does not clear the gate,
 * or `null` if it genuinely does.
 *
 * 🔴 Codex finding on PR #1205 round 2. The previous shape asked the question
 * backwards: it blocked only when it could *prove* something was missing, and
 * passed by default otherwise. Three malformed evaluation objects therefore
 * sailed a score-100 A-level PR straight to READY with zero blockers:
 *
 *   { readable: true }                              // no `missing` at all
 *   { readable: true, missing: 'not-an-array' }     // `Array.isArray` false
 *   { readable: true, missing: [], complete: false } // says so itself
 *
 * The first two are what a partially-built or partially-deserialised object
 * looks like; the third is an evaluation openly reporting it did not finish.
 * All three read as "nothing to report" to a check written as `else if
 * (Array.isArray(x.missing) && x.missing.length > 0)`, because an absent or
 * mistyped field makes that condition false — the same shape as success.
 *
 * So the question is asked the other way round. The gate clears only on a
 * *positive* assertion of completeness from a structurally valid result:
 * `readable === true`, `required` and `missing` both real arrays, `missing`
 * empty, and `complete === true`. Anything else — malformed, inconsistent, or
 * merely not-positively-complete — is a blocker. This is the same fail-closed
 * rule `risk.mjs` applies to an unreadable file list, applied to the evidence
 * side: "we could not tell" must never render as "there was nothing wrong".
