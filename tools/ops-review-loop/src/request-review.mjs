/**
 * Workflow A entrypoint (ops-codex-request-review.yml). Runs on every push to
 * a qualifying PR. Two things happen here, in order, per ME2-OPS03 PR2:
 *
 *   1. Rate the PR (`risk.mjs`, from its actual changed files — both ends of
 *      a rename) and post the rating, once per base+head pair: human text
 *      plus a hidden `me-dev-gate` marker (`gate-marker.mjs`). Idempotent —
 *      if a trusted marker already covers this exact base/head, nothing is
 *      re-posted.
 *   2. Decide whether this head still needs a Codex review (`sampling.mjs`:
 *      A and B always, C by a stable 20% sample) and, if so, post "@codex
 *      review" exactly once per head sha — unchanged from before this PR.
 *
 * Never merges, never deploys, never touches production.
