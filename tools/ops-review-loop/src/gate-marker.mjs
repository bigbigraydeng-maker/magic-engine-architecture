/**
 * The machine-readable half of the dev gate: one hidden HTML comment per
 * rating, carrying the level, the two shas it was computed from, and the
 * reasons.
 *
 *   <!-- me-dev-gate:{"v":1,"base":"<sha>","head":"<sha>","risk":"A","reasons":["..."]} -->
 *
 * 🔴 **Why the rating is bound to a pair of shas.**
 *
 * A rating describes a diff, and a diff is `base..head`. Carrying only the head
 * would make a rating look valid after a rebase or a base-branch merge changed
 * what the diff contains; carrying only the base would make it survive the very
 * push it is supposed to re-trigger on. Both are in the payload, and
 * `isGateCurrent` requires both to match — so the Product Owner's rule ("head
 * 一动，旧评级、旧质量分和旧 Codex 批准立即失效") is a comparison, not a habit.
 *
 * 🔴 **Why the payload is escaped before it is embedded.**
 *
 * The reasons are built from `risk.mjs`'s own table today, but they contain
 * file paths taken from the PR, and this string is embedded in an HTML comment.
 * A path containing `-->` would close the comment early and leave the rest of
 * the payload rendered as visible PR text — a marker that reads as valid to a
 * human while parsing as something else, or not at all. So every `<` and `>` in
 * the serialised JSON is written as a `\u003c` / `\u003e` escape (legal JSON,
 * decoded transparently by `JSON.parse`, and structurally impossible inside an
 * HTML comment delimiter), and the builder verifies the finished marker
 * round-trips before returning it. Same reasoning as `output.mjs`: if the
 * transport is forgeable, escaping the payload's *contents* fixes nothing.
 *
 * This module deliberately does not extend `markers.mjs`. That module's
 * `stage=/pr=/sha=` markers are the *loop's* state ledger and are matched by a
 * strict regex; this is a *rating record* with a structured payload. One regex
 * serving both would have to loosen to fit, and the loosened one is the one
 * that decides whether an automated push happens.

 * 🔴 Codex finding on PR #1205 (P2, second half): a gate marker is a *verdict*,

 * Without an author check, an author who did not like being rated A can post
