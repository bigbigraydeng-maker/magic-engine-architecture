/**
 * Stable sampling for the C-level review lane.
 *
 * C-level PRs (docs, styling, images, test-only) do not each need a Codex
 * review — paying for one on every push is what turned a six-file docs PR into
 * three full automated fix rounds (#1204, 2026-08-27). But sampling *none* of
 * them means a mis-rated change never gets a second pair of eyes, so a fixed
 * fraction is still reviewed.
 *
 * 🔴 **Why the sample must be stable, not random.**
 *
 * The decision is re-evaluated on every workflow run, and a run can be
 * re-delivered, retried, or raced by a duplicate event. With `Math.random()`
 * the same head sha could be "not sampled" on one delivery and "sampled" on the
 * next — which posts a second `@codex review`, restarts the loop, and makes the
 * dedup markers describe a PR that changed its mind. Worse, an author who
 * disliked the answer could re-run the job until it came out the other way.
 *
 * So the sample is a pure function of `(pr, head sha)`. The same commit always
 * gets the same answer, nobody can re-roll it, and it needs no state store —
 * the same property the marker ledger relies on elsewhere in this tool.
 *
 * The hash is FNV-1a/32, chosen because it is four lines of arithmetic with no
 * dependency (this tool runs on a bare runner with no `npm ci`). It is not a
 * cryptographic hash and does not need to be: nothing here is a secret, and the
 * input — a git sha — is already uniformly distributed. What is required is
 * determinism and an even spread, and FNV-1a gives both.
