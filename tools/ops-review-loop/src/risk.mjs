/**
 * Deterministic A/B/C risk rating for a pull request, computed from the files
 * the PR actually changed.
 *
 * 🔴 **Why this is code and not a prompt.**
 *
 * `docs/ENGINEERING_QUALITY_GATES.md` already defines what A, B and C mean.
 * What it could not define was *who decides*. Until now the answer was "the
 * agent writing the PR", which makes the rating an opinion — and an opinion
 * held by the same party the rating is supposed to constrain. An agent under
 * time pressure that can call its own change "C" has effectively removed the
 * gate. So the rating is computed here, from the diff, by rules a reviewer can
 * read; the PR author's own declaration is accepted only as a *floor*
 * (`classifyRisk` takes the higher of declared and computed), never as a
 * ceiling.
 *
 * Three consequences follow, and all three are deliberate:
 *
 * - **Unknown means A.** Unreadable file list, an entry with no filename, an
 *   empty list — every one of those is rated A with an explicit reason, because
 *   "we could not look" and "we looked and it was fine" must never produce the
 *   same output. This is the same fail-closed rule `fix-scope.mjs` already
 *   applies to the blast-radius guard.
 * - **C is a narrow allowlist, not a fallback.** A file is C-safe only if it
 *   matches an explicit low-risk pattern. Anything unrecognised is B. A diff is
 *   C only when *every* file in it is C-safe.
 * - **Over-classification is tolerated; under-classification is not.** A few
 *   rules here (a publisher module's own test file, this control plane's own
 *   README) rate higher than a human would. That costs one extra review round.
 *   The opposite error costs a production incident, so the asymmetry is priced
 *   in on purpose rather than tuned away.
 *
 * This module is pure: no I/O, no network, no clock. `tests/risk.test.ts`
 * exercises it offline.
