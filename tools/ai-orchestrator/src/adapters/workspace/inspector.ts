/**
 * Authoritative facts about what a turn actually did to the repository.
 *
 * The model's own `files_changed` / `commit_evidence` are a *description*. This is
 * the *record*.
 *
 * v0.2 got the record right but the *scope* wrong: it asked git for
 * `diff baseRef...HEAD`, which is everything the branch has accumulated since it
 * left main. From round 2 onward that means round 1's files are attributed to
 * round 2, `commit` is never null because HEAD always exists, and an honest
 * implementer reporting only what it just did is flagged as a liar.
 *
 * So the inspector captures **states**, and the runner diffs two of them around
 * each provider call. What a turn did is `after − before`; what the branch holds
 * in total is `after`. Policy uses both, for different questions.
