/**
 * Budget accounting with reservations.
 *
 * The first version compared *already-settled* spend against the cap, which meant
 * the cap could be crossed by the very next call: a run at $1.95 of a $2.00 cap
 * would happily start a $0.40 turn. A cap that is only checked after the money is
 * gone is not a cap.
 *
 * So money is committed **before** the call, not after:
 *
 *   reserve max_turn_cost -> call -> reconcile against actual usage
 *
 * and the run may only start a turn when `remaining >= max_turn_cost_usd`.
 *
 * Three kinds of commitment, all counted against the cap:
 *
 *   settled     a turn finished; actual usage is known
 *   outstanding a claim is live; the call may be in flight right now
 *   orphaned    a claim expired with no completion — we do not know whether the
 *               provider billed us, so we assume it did
 *
 * Orphaned reservations are deliberately never released. Releasing them would let
 * a crash-loop spend without limit, which is the failure this exists to prevent.
