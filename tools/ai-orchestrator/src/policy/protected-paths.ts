/**
 * The self-protection surface.
 *
 * **The whole orchestrator is protected, not a hand-picked subset.** The first
 * version listed `policy/`, `prompts/` and `state-machine.ts` and left `runner.ts`,
 * `schema.ts`, the ledger, every adapter, `config/`, `digest`, `fold` and `lease`
 * writable — each of which can defeat the guards just as thoroughly. Any file that
 * can change what the orchestrator is allowed to do belongs here, and it is easier
 * to be right about "all of it" than about a list.
 *
 * Consequence, and it is intended: **the orchestrator cannot upgrade itself.**
 * Changing this tool is a separate, human-initiated, human-reviewed change.
 * `workPackageScopeSchema` refuses to parse an authorization whose allowed paths
 * overlap this surface, so a self-modifying work package cannot even be built.
 *
 * Defence in depth (weakest listed last):
 *   1. GITHUB_TOKEN has no `workflows: write`, so GitHub itself rejects any push
 *      that touches `.github/workflows/**`. This holds on GitHub Free.
 *   2. `workPackageScopeSchema` rejects an authorization that grants this surface.
 *   3. `enforceProtectedPaths` rejects the turn, using the *real* changed-file list
 *      from git or the GitHub PR — never the model's self-report.
 *   4. `ControlPlaneIntegrityChecker` re-reads the surface after each turn and
 *      halts on drift, catching changes that were made but not reported anywhere.
 *   5. Branch protection + CODEOWNERS — NOT available on this repository today
 *      (private repo on the Free plan). Tracked as an Enable-phase blocker.
